# Fast Edge-Aware Occlusion Detection in the Context of Multispectral Camera Arrays

This code provides the edge-aware occlusion detection algorithm for a disparity map of SceneFlow.
The CAMSI images can be reproduced by plugging this algorithm into the cross spectral image registration pipeline [here](https://github.com/FAU-LMS/MSIR).
